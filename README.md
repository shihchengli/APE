# Automated Property Estimator | APE

**Automated Property Estimator (APE)** software is a tool to automatically calculate the thermodynamic properties with considering anharmonic effect. All calculations were done using a development version of the [QChem](http://www.q-chem.com/) software package.

Currently, APE can only estimate the thermodynamic property of a given molecule.

**This software is still work in progress to develop more functions.**

## Clone and setup path
Befor installing APE, download [Anacinda](anaconda.com/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Install the latest version of APE by cloning the source code via Git.

- `git clone https://github.com/shihchengli/APE.git`

Add APE to your local path in .bashrc (make sure to change ~/Path/to/APE/ accordingly):

- `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/Path/to/APE/`

## Install dependencies

- Install the latest DEVELOPER version of RMG (which has Arkane). It is recommended to follow RMG’s [Developer installation by source using Anaconda](http://reactionmechanismgenerator.github.io/RMG-Py/users/rmg/installation/index.html#for-developers-installation-by-source-using-anaconda-environment) instructions. Make sure to add RMG-Py to your PATH and PYTHONPATH variables as explained in RMG’s documentation.

- Clone [pysisyphus](https://github.com/eljost/pysisyphus) in a separate folder and add it to your PYTHONPATH just as well.

  `git clone https://github.com/eljost/pysisyphus.git`

- Create an Anaconda environment for APE:

  `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  
- Modify environment variables. Add APE to the `PYTHONPATH` to ensure that you can access modules from any folder. Modify your ~/.bashrc file by adding the following line:

  `export APE="your_folder/APE`
  
  `export PYTHONPATH=$APE:PYTHONPATH`
  
- Finally either close and reopen your terminal to refresh your environment variables, or type the following command

  `source ~/.bashrc`

- Activate the APE environment every time before you run APE:

  `source activate ape_env`

## How to run a job

To run APE, make sure to first activate the APE environment

- Basic run
  `python <path_to_the_APE_folder>/APE.py freq_output.q.out -p <UMN or UMVT (default)>`

- Using the API

  `from ape.main import APE`
  
  `ape = APE(input_file, name=None, project_directory=None, protocol=None, multiplicity=None, charge = None, external_symmetry=None, level_of_theory=None, basis=None, ncpus=None)`
  
  `ape.execute()`
